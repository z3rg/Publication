#USB HDD as a Storage for ESXi

### USB Drive Recommendations
There are no limitations when it comes to the form factor or USB drives. You can use small USB flash drives, large 3.5" USB Hard Drives with high capacity, or USB-based External Solid State Drives. Due to performance and endurance issues, I would not recommend using inexpensive USB thumb drives for Datastores.

## Prerequisites
Some commands require SSH access to the ESXi host, which can be enabled from the vSphere Client > ESXi Host > Configure > System > Services > SSH > Start or from the ESXi Host Client > Host > Manage >  Services > TSM-SSH > Start. When enabled, you can login to the ESXi host using an SSH client like PuTTY.
